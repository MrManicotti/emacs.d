First, the package recipe is registered with straight.el. If

package name as a string, and a boolean value indicating whether
the local repository for the package is available. In that case,
the return value of the function is used as the value of NO-CLONE
instead. In any case, if NO-CLONE is non-nil, then processing
stops here.

Otherwise, the repository is cloned, if it is missing. If
NO-BUILD is a function, then it is called with one argument: the
package name as a string. In that case, the return value of the
function is used as the value of NO-BUILD instead. In any case,
if NO-BUILD is non-nil, then processing halts here. Otherwise,
the package is built and activated. Note that if the package
recipe has a nil `:build' entry, then NO-BUILD is ignored
and processing always stops before building and activation
occurs.

                 execute until the lazy load has occurred.
:preface         Code to be run before everything except `:disabled'; this
                 can be used to define functions for use in `:if', or that
                 should be seen by the byte-compiler.

:mode            Form to be added to `auto-mode-alist'.

:magic-fallback  Form to be added to `magic-fallback-mode-alist'.
:interpreter     Form to be added to `interpreter-mode-alist'.

:commands        Define autoloads for commands that will be defined by the
                 package.  This is useful if the package is being lazily
                 loaded, and you wish to conditionally call functions in your
                 `:init' block that are defined in the package.
:hook            Specify hook(s) to attach this package to.

:bind            Bind keys, and define autoloads for the bound commands.
:bind*           Bind keys, and define autoloads for the bound commands,
                 *overriding all minor mode bindings*.
:bind-keymap     Bind a key prefix to an auto-loaded keymap defined in the
                 package.  This is like `:bind', but for keymaps.
:bind-keymap*    Like `:bind-keymap', but overrides all minor mode bindings

:defer           Defer loading of a package -- this is implied when using
                 `:commands', `:bind', `:bind*', `:mode', `:magic', `:hook',
                 `:magic-fallback', or `:interpreter'.  This can be an integer,
                 to force loading after N seconds of idle time, if the package
                 has not already been loaded.
:after           Delay the use-package declaration until after the named modules
                 have loaded. Once load, it will be as though the use-package
                 declaration (without `:after') had been seen at that moment.
:demand          Prevent the automatic deferred loading introduced by constructs
                 such as `:bind' (see `:defer' for the complete list).

:if EXPR         Initialize and load only if EXPR evaluates to a non-nil value.
:disabled        The package is ignored completely if this keyword is present.
:defines         Declare certain variables to silence the byte-compiler.
:functions       Declare certain functions to silence the byte-compiler.
:load-path       Add to the `load-path' before attempting to load the package.
:diminish        Support for diminish.el (if installed).
:delight         Support for delight.el (if installed).
:custom          Call `custom-set' or `set-default' with each variable
                 definition without modifying the Emacs `custom-file'.
                 (compare with `custom-set-variables').
:custom-face     Call `customize-set-faces' with each face definition.
:ensure          Loads the package using package.el if necessary.
:pin             Pin the package to an archive.

that are unnecessary, as well as bindings that conflict with
other bindings.

Adding the above bindings is delayed until `after-init-hook'

init file (without having to make sure to do so before `magit'

all the potentially conflicting user bindings have already

Do not use the function `customize-set-variable' because doing
that would cause Magit to be loaded immediately when that form
is evaluated (this differs from `custom-set-variables', which
doesn't load the libraries that define the customized variables).

Setting this variable to nil has no effect if that is done after
the key bindings have already been added.

We recommend that you bind \"C-c g\" instead of \"C-c M-g\" to
`magit-file-dispatch'.  The former is a much better binding

Special case:
If the output of START-FUNC is a string with properties
e.g. (buffer-string) RESULT will be transformed in a list where the
car is the string itself (without props) and the cdr the rest of
properties, this allows using in FINISH-FUNC the string without
properties and then apply the properties in cdr to this string (if
needed).
Properties handling special objects like markers are returned as
list to allow restoring them later.
See <https://github.com/jwiegley/emacs-async/issues/145> for more infos.

Note: Even when FINISH-FUNC is present, a future is still
returned except that it yields no value (since the value is

** Keywords

Keywords supported:

- :sources
- :input
- :prompt
- :resume
- :preselect
- :buffer
- :keymap
- :default
- :history
- :allow-nest

Extra LOCAL-VARS keywords are supported, see the \"** Other
keywords\" section below.

Basic keywords are the following:

*** :sources

One of the following:

- List of sources
- Symbol whose value is a list of sources
- Alist representing a Helm source.
  - In this case the source has no name and is referenced in
    `helm-sources' as a whole alist.

*** :input

Initial input of minibuffer (temporary value of `helm-pattern')

*** :prompt

Minibuffer prompt. Default value is `helm--prompt'.

*** :resume

If t, allow resumption of the previous session of this Helm
command, skipping initialization.

If \\='noresume, this instance of `helm' cannot be resumed.

*** :preselect

Initially selected candidate (string or regexp).

*** :buffer

Buffer name for this Helm session. `helm-buffer' will take this value.

*** :keymap

[Obsolete]

Keymap used at the start of this Helm session.

It is overridden by keymaps specified in sources, and is kept
only for backward compatibility.

Keymaps should be specified in sources using the :keymap slot
instead. See `helm-source'.

This keymap is not restored by `helm-resume'.

*** :default

Default value inserted into the minibuffer with
\\<minibuffer-local-map>\\[next-history-element].

It can be a string or a list of strings, in this case
\\<minibuffer-local-map>\\[next-history-element] cycles through
the list items, starting with the first.

If nil, `thing-at-point' is used.

If `helm-maybe-use-default-as-input' is non-nil, display is
updated using this value if this value matches, otherwise it is
ignored. If :input is specified, it takes precedence on :default.

*** :history

Minibuffer input, by default, is pushed to `minibuffer-history'.

When an argument HISTORY is provided, input is pushed to
HISTORY. HISTORY should be a valid symbol.

*** :allow-nest

Allow running this Helm command in a running Helm session.

** Other keywords

Other keywords are interpreted as local variables of this Helm
session. The `helm-' prefix can be omitted. For example,

(helm :sources \\='helm-source-buffers-list
       :buffer \"*helm buffers*\"
       :candidate-number-limit 10)

Starts a Helm session with the variable
`helm-candidate-number-limit' set to 10.

** Backward compatibility

For backward compatibility, positional parameters are
supported:

(helm sources input prompt resume preselect

- PROMPT is the prompt name to use.

- COLLECTION can be a list, alist, vector, obarray or hash-table.
  For alists and hash-tables their car are use as real value of
  candidate unless ALISTP is non-nil.
  It can be also a function that receives three arguments:
  the values string, predicate and t. See `all-completions' for more details.

Keys description:

- TEST: A predicate called with one arg i.e candidate.

- INITIAL-INPUT: Same as input arg in `helm'.

- PRESELECT: See preselect arg of `helm'.

- DEFAULT: This option is used only for compatibility with regular
  Emacs `completing-read' (Same as DEFAULT arg of `completing-read').

- BUFFER: Name of helm-buffer.

- MUST-MATCH: Candidate selected must be one of COLLECTION.

- FUZZY: Enable fuzzy matching.

- REVERSE-HISTORY: When non--nil display history source after current
  source completion.

- REQUIRES-PATTERN: Same as helm attribute, default is 0.

- HISTORY: A symbol where each result will be saved.
  If not specified as a symbol an error will popup.
  When specified, all elements of HISTORY are displayed in
  a special source before or after COLLECTION according to REVERSE-HISTORY.
  The main difference with INPUT-HISTORY is that the result of the
  completion is saved whereas in INPUT-HISTORY it is the minibuffer
  contents which is saved when you exit.
  Don't use the same symbol for INPUT-HISTORY and HISTORY.
  NOTE: As mentionned above this has nothing to do with
  `minibuffer-history-variable', therefore if you want to save this
  history persistently, you will have to add this variable to the
  relevant variable of your favorite tool for persistent emacs session
  i.e. psession, desktop etc...

- RAW-HISTORY: When non-nil do not remove backslashs if some in
  HISTORY candidates.

- INPUT-HISTORY: A symbol. The minibuffer input history will be
  stored there, if nil or not provided, `minibuffer-history'
  will be used instead.  You can navigate in this history with
  `M-p' and `M-n'.
  Don't use the same symbol for INPUT-HISTORY and HISTORY.

- CASE-FOLD: Same as `helm-case-fold-search'.

- PERSISTENT-ACTION: A function called with one arg i.e candidate.

- PERSISTENT-HELP: A string to document PERSISTENT-ACTION.

- MODE-LINE: A string or list to display in mode line.
  Default is `helm-comp-read-mode-line'.

- KEYMAP: A keymap to use in this `helm-comp-read'.
  (the keymap will be shared with history source)

- NAME: The name related to this local source.

- HEADER-NAME: A function to alter NAME, see `helm'.

- EXEC-WHEN-ONLY-ONE: Bound `helm-execute-action-at-once-if-one'
  to non--nil. (possibles values are t or nil).

- VOLATILE: Use volatile attribute.

- SORT: A predicate to give to `sort' e.g `string-lessp'
  Use this only on small data as it is inefficient.
  If you want to sort faster add a sort function to
  FC-TRANSFORMER.
  Note that FUZZY when enabled is already providing a sort function.

- FC-TRANSFORMER: A `filtered-candidate-transformer' function
  or a list of functions.

- HIST-FC-TRANSFORMER: A `filtered-candidate-transformer'
  function for the history source.

- MARKED-CANDIDATES: If non-nil return candidate or marked candidates as a list.

- NOMARK: When non--nil don't allow marking candidates.

- ALISTP:
  When non-nil (default) pass the value of (DISPLAY . REAL)
  candidate in COLLECTION to action when COLLECTION is an alist or a
  hash-table, otherwise DISPLAY is always returned as result on exit,
  which is the default when using `completing-read'.
  See `helm-comp-read-get-candidates'.

- CANDIDATES-IN-BUFFER: when non--nil use a source build with
  `helm-source-in-buffer' which is much faster.
  Argument VOLATILE have no effect when CANDIDATES-IN-BUFFER is non--nil.

- MATCH-PART: Allow matching only one part of candidate.
  See match-part documentation in `helm-source'.

- MATCH-DYNAMIC: See match-dynamic in `helm-source-sync'
  It has no effect when used with CANDIDATES-IN-BUFFER.

- ALLOW-NEST: Allow nesting this `helm-comp-read' in a helm session.
  See `helm'.

- MULTILINE: See multiline in `helm-source'.

- COERCE: See coerce in `helm-source'.

- GROUP: See group in `helm-source'.

Any prefix args passed during `helm-comp-read' invocation will be recorded
in `helm-current-prefix-arg', otherwise if prefix args were given before
`helm-comp-read' invocation, the value of `current-prefix-arg' will be used.
That means you can pass prefix args before or after calling a command
that use `helm-comp-read'.  See `helm-M-x' for example.

NAME should be a symbol, it will be the prefix of all functions

BODY has the format:

    (BODY-MAP BODY-KEY &rest BODY-PLIST)

DOCSTRING will be displayed in the echo area to identify the
Hydra.  When DOCSTRING starts with a newline, special Ruby-style
substitution will be performed by `hydra--format'.

Functions are created on basis of HEADS, each of which has the
format:

    (KEY CMD &optional HINT &rest PLIST)

BODY-MAP is a keymap; `global-map' is used quite often.  Each
function generated from HEADS will be bound in BODY-MAP to
BODY-KEY + KEY (both are strings passed to `kbd'), and will set
the transient map so that all following heads can be called
though KEY only.  BODY-KEY can be an empty string.

CMD is a callable expression: either an interactive function
name, or an interactive lambda, or a single sexp (it will be
wrapped in an interactive lambda).

HINT is a short string that identifies its head.  It will be
printed beside KEY in the echo erea if `hydra-is-helpful' is not
nil.  If you don't even want the KEY to be printed, set HINT
explicitly to nil.

The heads inherit their PLIST from BODY-PLIST and are allowed to
override some keys.  The keys recognized are :exit, :bind, and :column.
:exit can be:

- nil (default): this head will continue the Hydra state.
- t: this head will stop the Hydra state.

:bind can be:
- nil: this head will not be bound in BODY-MAP.
- a lambda taking KEY and CMD used to bind a head.

:column is a string that sets the column for all subsequent heads.

It is possible to omit both BODY-MAP and BODY-KEY if you don't
want to bind anything.  In that case, typically you will bind the
generated NAME/body command.  This command is also the return
result of `defhydra'.

POSITION can be:
1. An integer, meaning point position.
2. A cons of two integers, meaning absolute X and Y coordinates.
3. Other type, in which case the corresponding POSHANDLER should be
   provided.

 (2) POSHANDLER

POSHANDLER is a function of one argument returning an actual
position.  Its argument is a plist of the following form:

  (:position xxx
   :poshandler xxx
   :font-height xxx
   :font-width xxx
   :posframe xxx
   :posframe-width xxx
   :posframe-height xxx
   :posframe-buffer xxx

   :parent-window-height xxx
   :mouse-x xxx
   ;mouse-y xxx
   :minibuffer-height xxx
   :mode-line-height  xxx
   :header-line-height xxx
   :tab-line-height xxx
   :x-pixel-offset xxx
   :y-pixel-offset xxx)

By default, poshandler is auto-selected based on the type of POSITION,
but the selection can be overridden using the POSHANDLER argument.

The names of poshandler functions are like:

   `posframe-poshandler-p0.5p0-to-w0.5p1'

which mean align posframe(0.5, 0) to a position(a, b)

1. a = x of window(0.5, 0)
2. b = y of point(1, 1)

    posframe(p), frame(f), window(w), point(p), mouse(m)

         (0,0)      (0.5,0)      (1,0)
          +------------+-----------+

          +------------+-----------+
         (0,1)      (0.5,1)      (1,1)

The alias of builtin poshandler functions are listed below:

1.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-center'
2.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-top-center'
3.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-top-left-corner'
4.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-top-right-corner'
5.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-bottom-center'
6.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-bottom-left-corner'
7.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-bottom-right-corner'
8.  `posframe-poshandler-window-center'
9.  `posframe-poshandler-window-top-center'
10. `posframe-poshandler-window-top-left-corner'
11. `posframe-poshandler-window-top-right-corner'
12. `posframe-poshandler-window-bottom-center'
13. `posframe-poshandler-window-bottom-left-corner'
14. `posframe-poshandler-window-bottom-right-corner'
15. `posframe-poshandler-point-top-left-corner'
16. `posframe-poshandler-point-bottom-left-corner'
17. `posframe-poshandler-point-bottom-left-corner-upward'
18. `posframe-poshandler-point-window-center'

by the way, poshandler can be used by other packages easily with
the help of function `posframe-poshandler-argbuilder'.  like:

   (let* ((info (posframe-poshandler-argbuilder *MY-CHILD-FRAME*))
          (posn (posframe-poshandler-window-center
                 `(:posframe-width 800 :posframe-height 400 ,@info))))
     `((left . ,(car posn))
       (top . ,(cdr posn))))

 (3) POSHANDLER-EXTRA-INFO

POSHANDLER-EXTRA-INFO is a plist, which will prepend to the
argument of poshandler function: `info', it will *OVERRIDE* the
exist key in `info'.

 (4) BUFFER-OR-NAME

This posframe's buffer is BUFFER-OR-NAME, which can be a buffer
or a name of a (possibly nonexistent) buffer.

buffer name can prefix with space, for example \" *mybuffer*\", so
the buffer name will hide for ibuffer and `list-buffers'.

 (5) NO-PROPERTIES

If NO-PROPERTIES is non-nil, The STRING's properties will
be removed before being shown in posframe.

 (6) HEIGHT, MAX-HEIGHT, MIN-HEIGHT, WIDTH, MAX-WIDTH and MIN-WIDTH

These arguments are specified in the canonical character width
and height of posframe, more details can be found in docstring of
function `fit-frame-to-buffer',

 (7) LEFT-FRINGE and RIGHT-FRINGE

If LEFT-FRINGE or RIGHT-FRINGE is a number, left fringe or
right fringe with be shown with the specified width.

 (8) BORDER-WIDTH, BORDER-COLOR, INTERNAL-BORDER-WIDTH and INTERNAL-BORDER-COLOR

By default, posframe shows no borders, but users can specify
borders by setting BORDER-WIDTH to a positive number.  Border
color can be specified by BORDER-COLOR.

INTERNAL-BORDER-WIDTH and INTERNAL-BORDER-COLOR are same as
BORDER-WIDTH and BORDER-COLOR, but do not suggest to use for the
reason:

   Add distinct controls for child frames' borders (Bug#45620)
   http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/commit/?id=ff7b1a133bfa7f2614650f8551824ffaef13fadc

 (9) FONT, FOREGROUND-COLOR and BACKGROUND-COLOR

Posframe's font as well as foreground and background colors are
derived from the current frame by default, but can be overridden
using the FONT, FOREGROUND-COLOR and BACKGROUND-COLOR arguments,
respectively.

 (10) RESPECT-HEADER-LINE and RESPECT-MODE-LINE

By default, posframe will display no header-line, mode-line and
tab-line.  In case a header-line, mode-line or tab-line is
desired, users can set RESPECT-HEADER-LINE and RESPECT-MODE-LINE
to t.

 (11) INITIALIZE

INITIALIZE is a function with no argument.  It will run when
posframe buffer is first selected with `with-current-buffer'
in `posframe-show', and only run once (for performance reasons).

 (12) LINES-TRUNCATE

If LINES-TRUNCATE is non-nil, then lines will truncate in the
posframe instead of wrap.

 (13) OVERRIDE-PARAMETERS

OVERRIDE-PARAMETERS is very powful, *all* the valid frame parameters
used by posframe's frame can be overridden by it.

NOTE: some `posframe-show' arguments are not frame parameters, so they
can not be overrided by this argument.

 (14) TIMEOUT

TIMEOUT can specify the number of seconds after which the posframe
will auto-hide.

 (15) REFRESH

If REFRESH is a number, posframe's frame-size will be re-adjusted
every REFRESH seconds.

 (16) ACCEPT-FOCUS

When ACCEPT-FOCUS is non-nil, posframe will accept focus.
be careful, you may face some bugs when set it to non-nil.

 (17) HIDEHANDLER

HIDEHANDLER is a function, when it return t, posframe will be
hide, this function has a plist argument:

  (:posframe-buffer xxx
   :posframe-parent-buffer xxx)

The builtin hidehandler functions are listed below:

1. `posframe-hidehandler-when-buffer-switch'

 (18) REFPOSHANDLER

REFPOSHANDLER is a function, a reference position (most is
top-left of current frame) will be returned when call this
function.

when it is nil or it return nil, child-frame feature will be used
and reference position will be deal with in Emacs.

The user case I know at the moment is let ivy-posframe work well
in EXWM environment (let posframe show on the other appliction
window).

         DO NOT USE UNLESS NECESSARY!!!

An example parent frame poshandler function is:

1. `posframe-refposhandler-xwininfo'

 (19) Others

You can use `posframe-delete-all' to delete all posframes.

the project using the following methods, in the order they are listed:

- the current projectile.el project, if `treemacs-projectile' is installed
- the current project.el project
- the current `default-directory'

The update will only happen when treemacs is in the foreground, meaning a

This acts as more fine-grained alternative to `treemacs-follow-mode' and will
thus disable `treemacs-follow-mode' on activation.  When enabled treemacs will
focus not only the file of the current buffer, but also the tag at point.

The follow action is attached to Emacs' idle timer and will run
`treemacs-tag-follow-delay' seconds of idle time.  The delay value is not an
integer, meaning it accepts floating point values like 1.5.

Every time a tag is followed a re--scan of the imenu index is forced by
temporarily setting `imenu-auto-rescan' to t (though a cache is applied as long
as the buffer is unmodified).  This is necessary to assure that creation or
deletion of tags does not lead to errors and guarantees an always up-to-date tag
view.

Note that in order to move to a tag in treemacs the treemacs buffer's window
needs to be temporarily selected, which will reset blink-cursor-mode's timer if
it is enabled.  This will result in the cursor blinking seemingly pausing for a
short time and giving the appearance of the tag follow action lasting much
longer than it really does.

`company-complete-common', `company-complete-selection', `company-complete',
`company-select-next', `company-select-previous'.  If these commands are

Completions can be searched with `company-search-candidates' or

inactive, as well.

The completion data is retrieved using `company-backends' and displayed
using `company-frontends'.  If you want to start a specific backend, call
it interactively or use `company-begin-backend'.

By default, the completions list is sorted alphabetically, unless the
